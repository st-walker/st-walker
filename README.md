## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently working at [DESY](https://www.desy.de) on the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser Facility ([EuXFEL](https://www.xfel.eu)).
- ðŸ”­ My research focuses on electron beam dynamics in high energy photo injectors, and the application of machine learning to free electron lasers.
- ðŸ’» I also developed and continue to maintain the longitudinal phase space diagnostics software at the EuXFEL, found [here](https://github.com/st-walker/esme).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the application of the Fokker-Planck equation to the problem of intrabeam scattering modelling in our photoinjector.
